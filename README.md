# Onward
# A game created through Java AWT and Swing in which the user battles different monster classes, collects coins, and changes the plot of the story with their various choices. All pixel art, story, and design elements are of my own creation. The game concludes when either the user defeats the final boss, or their health bar is reduced to 0.
